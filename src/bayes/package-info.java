/**
 * 	This package contains only the Naive Bayes Classifier's class. 
 * <p> 	In the NaiveBayesClassifier class we go through each Instance of the Test File and
 * compute the joint probability P_B. Depending on the value of this probability, a prediction
 * is done for the Class Variable of that instance. Later all the predictions are compared with 
 * the real values in the Test Set and an accuracy for the TANBC is created. Other requested
 * evaluation metrics are also computed in this class.
